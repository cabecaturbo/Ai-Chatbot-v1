- [ ] Add distributed tracing for request flow analysis
- [ ] Implement alerting for system health and performance
- [ ] Create comprehensive dashboards for operations

#### 4.4 Security Hardening
- [ ] Implement advanced threat detection and prevention
- [ ] Add data encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Implement audit logging and compliance features
- [ ] Add advanced access control and authentication

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tenant management
tenants (id, name, email, subscription_status, created_at)
api_keys (id, tenant_id, key_hash, name, permissions, created_at)

-- Tenant-specific data
conversations (id, tenant_id, session_id, created_at)
messages (id, tenant_id, conversation_id, role, content, timestamp)
leads (id, tenant_id, intent, contact_info, created_at)

-- Configuration
tenant_configurations (id, tenant_id, config_type, config_data)
knowledge_bases (id, tenant_id, content, updated_at)
```

### API Architecture
```
POST /api/v1/chat
Headers: X-API-Key: tenant-api-key
Body: { session_id, message }

POST /api/v1/crisp/webhook
Headers: X-API-Key: tenant-api-key
Body: { conversation_id, message }

GET /api/v1/admin/tenants
Headers: Authorization: Bearer admin-token

GET /api/v1/customer/config
Headers: Authorization: Bearer customer-token
```

### Frontend Architecture
- **Next.js 14** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation
- **JWT authentication** with role-based access
- **Axios** for API communication

## Success Metrics

### Technical Goals
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Support 100+ concurrent tenants
- **Performance**: < 500ms response time per tenant
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Security**: Zero data leakage between tenants

### Business Goals
- **Customer Onboarding**: < 5 minutes to first working chatbot
- **Self-Service**: 80% of configuration done by customers
- **Retention**: 90%+ monthly retention rate
- **Revenue**: $10K+ MRR within 6 months

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data Isolation**: Comprehensive testing of tenant separation
- **Performance**: Load testing with multiple tenants
- **Security**: Regular security audits and penetration testing
- **Scalability**: Database optimization and caching strategies

### Business Risks
- **Customer Adoption**: Gradual rollout with early adopters
- **Competition**: Focus on unique value propositions
- **Support Load**: Self-service tools and documentation
- **Revenue Model**: Flexible pricing and free trial options
