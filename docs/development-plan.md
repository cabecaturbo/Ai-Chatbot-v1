## Technical Implementation

### TypeScript Migration Benefits
The TypeScript migration in Phase 1 provides several key advantages for the multi-tenant SaaS development:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time, reducing runtime bugs
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete, refactoring, and navigation
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Types serve as living documentation
- **Easier Refactoring**: Safe code changes with confidence
- **Team Collaboration**: Clear interfaces and contracts between modules
- **Future-Proofing**: Better foundation for complex multi-tenant features

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tenant management
tenants (id, name, email, subscription_status, papercups_account_id, created_at)
api_keys (id, tenant_id, key_hash, name, permissions, created_at)

-- Tenant-specific data
conversations (id, tenant_id, session_id, created_at)
messages (id, tenant_id, conversation_id, role, content, timestamp)
leads (id, tenant_id, intent, contact_info, created_at)

-- Configuration
tenant_configurations (id, tenant_id, config_type, config_data)
knowledge_bases (id, tenant_id, content, updated_at)
```

### API Architecture
```
POST /api/v1/chat
Headers: X-API-Key: tenant-api-key
Body: { session_id, message }

POST /papercups/webhook
Headers: X-Papercups-Signature: webhook-signature
Body: { account_id, event, data: { content, from, conversation_id } }

GET /api/v1/admin/tenants
Headers: Authorization: Bearer admin-token

GET /api/v1/customer/config
Headers: Authorization: Bearer customer-token
```

### Backend Architecture (Post-TypeScript Migration)
- **Node.js** with **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Express.js** with typed middleware and routes
- **PostgreSQL** with typed database queries
- **Redis** for caching and rate limiting
- **OpenAI API** with typed response interfaces
- **Prometheus** metrics with typed collectors

### Frontend Architecture
- **Next.js 14** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation
- **Neon Auth** with passwordless magic link authentication
- **Stack Auth** for authentication provider
- **Axios** for API communication

## Success Metrics

### Technical Goals
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Support 100+ concurrent tenants
- **Performance**: < 500ms response time per tenant
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Security**: Zero data leakage between tenants

### Business Goals
- **Customer Onboarding**: < 5 minutes to first working chatbot
- **Self-Service**: 80% of configuration done by customers
- **Retention**: 90%+ monthly retention rate
- **Revenue**: $10K+ MRR within 6 months

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data Isolation**: Comprehensive testing of tenant separation
- **Performance**: Load testing with multiple tenants
- **Security**: Regular security audits and penetration testing
- **Scalability**: Database optimization and caching strategies

### Business Risks
- **Customer Adoption**: Gradual rollout with early adopters
- **Competition**: Focus on unique value propositions
- **Support Load**: Self-service tools and documentation
- **Revenue Model**: Flexible pricing and free trial options
