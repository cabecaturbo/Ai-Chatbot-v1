## Code Quality
- Run linting and formatting before commits
- Write tests for new functionality
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

## Database Changes
- Update the single `docs/database.md` file as the source of truth for schema
- Document all schema changes in the database.md file with clear descriptions
- Test schema changes on development database first
- Update type definitions when schema changes
- Use the database.md file to understand current schema state

## Environment Management
- Never commit sensitive data to git
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Document all required environment variables
- Use different configs for dev/staging/production

## Testing
- Write unit tests for business logic
