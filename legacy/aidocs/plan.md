# Netia AI Chatbot - Multi-Tenant SaaS Development Plan

## Executive Summary

Transform the current single-tenant chatbot into a multi-tenant SaaS platform where multiple businesses can use the same AI service with their own data, configurations, and branding. This plan outlines the evolution from the current working system to a scalable SaaS platform.

## Target Architecture

## Technical Architecture

### **Database Schema**
```sql
-- Core tenant management
tenants (id, name, email, subscription_status, created_at)
api_keys (id, tenant_id, key_hash, name, permissions, created_at)

-- Tenant-specific data
conversations (id, tenant_id, session_id, created_at)
messages (id, tenant_id, conversation_id, role, content, timestamp)
leads (id, tenant_id, intent, contact_info, created_at)

-- Configuration
tenant_configurations (id, tenant_id, config_type, config_data)
knowledge_bases (id, tenant_id, content, updated_at)
```

### **API Architecture**
```
POST /api/v1/chat
Headers: X-API-Key: tenant-api-key
Body: { session_id, message }

POST /api/v1/crisp/webhook
Headers: X-API-Key: tenant-api-key
Body: { conversation_id, message }

GET /api/v1/admin/tenants
Headers: Authorization: Bearer admin-token
